1459	NIH	Our goal is to identify early biomarkers of effective antibody responses to flu vaccination. Four aims are proposed to meet this goal: Aim 1: To establish the baseline immune profiles in healthy subjects. Aim 2: To establish the immune profiles of Flu vaccination in healthy subjects. Aim 3: To identify the molecular signatures of DC subset(s) in response to Flu vaccination. Aim 4: To identify the molecular signatures of activated monocytes in response to Flu vaccination. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Despite the success of vaccines, we understand little about how effective ones stimulate protective immune responses. We will study how the flu vaccine generates effective antibody responses. The goal is to identify the immune responses elicited by effective vaccines so that vaccines that aren't as effective can be improved. To do this, we will vaccinate healthy people with the flu vaccine and monitor their immune response following the vaccination.	2015-07-06 00:00:00	AI089987	http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8691692&icde=23828587&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=3&csb=default&cs=ASC	Systems Analysis Vaccine Responses in Healthy and Hyporesponsive Humans	15	2010-07-07 00:00:00
