30	NIH	The mission of the trans-NIH CHI is cooperative research based on advanced technologies in order to efficiently translate enhanced understanding of immune function and pathophysiology to the clinic. The Center is based on cooperative research, technologically driven with the goal of understanding human immunology, and addressing pathophysiologically-related human diseases. This initiative is translational, but this overused term is defined here as both directly resulting in improved therapy of immune-mediated diseases and deriving important and often unique biologic information from the study of ill human beings.	2017-10-01 00:00:00		NIH Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation (CHI)	2012-09-21 00:00:00
