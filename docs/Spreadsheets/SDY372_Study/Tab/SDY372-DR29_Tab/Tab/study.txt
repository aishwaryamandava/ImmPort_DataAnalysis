It will address the following questions: 1) which are the best biomarkers of protective immune response to influenza vaccine in healthy children; 2) how unique autoimmune backgrounds set the stage for responsiveness/unresponsiveness to vaccines; 3) whether vaccination contributes to increase the breadth of autoimmunity in a disease-specific manner. Ultimately, we expect that these studies will shed light on basic aspects of humoral immune responses to vaccines and will permit us to discover biomarkers of response that can be applied to healthy children and to the general population.	10.21430/M3NOD39G06	To gain a comprehensive view of the immune alterations associated with a potent response to flu vaccination using immunological and system biology approaches.	Both	We will be able to gain a comprehensive view of the immune alterations associated with a potent response to flu vaccination using immunological and system biology approaches. Furthermore, we theorize that the efficiency of vaccination is influenced by how unique autoimmune backgrounds set the stage for responsiveness to vaccines.	2016-03-18 00:00:00	DR18	TIV Fluzone	2018-07-06 00:00:00	DR27	17	6	This Project will study vaccine responses in sick children.
