Antibody titer	Antibody titer is a titer of antibody that shows how much antibody an organism has produced that recognizes a particular epitope, expressed as the greatest dilution ratio (or its reciprocal) that still gives a positive result. ELISA is a common means of determining antibody titers.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0000150	Titer

Cq	Threshold cycle (or Ct or Cq) is a count which is defined as the fractional PCR cycle number at which the reporter fluorescence is greater than the threshold in the context of the RT-qPCR assay.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/STATO_0000190	PCR

IU	The unitage assigned by the WHO to International Biological Standards - substances, classed as biological according to the criteria provided by WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (e.g. hormones, enzymes, and vaccines), to enable the results of biological and immunological assay procedures to be expressed in the same way throughout the world. The definition of an international unit is generally arbitrary and technical, and has to be officially approved by the International Conference for Unification of Formulae.	http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&code=C48579&ns=NCI_Thesaurus	mass

DK units/ml	The NIDDK calibrators were tested together with dilutions of the WHO reference serum using harmonized assays on five occasions in the BDC, Bristol, and Munich laboratories and reported as WHO units/ml by calibration as previously described. For each of the NIDDK calibrators, the median value of the WHO units/ml obtained for the 15 measurements was assigned as its calibrator unit. The assigned units were termed digestive and kidney units (DK units)/ml.	https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/studies/aab-calibrators/	concentration
