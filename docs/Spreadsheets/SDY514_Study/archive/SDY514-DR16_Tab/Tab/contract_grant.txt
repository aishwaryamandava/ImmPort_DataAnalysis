(2) How do responses elicited by a vaccine against a particular pathogen differ from those associated witti actual infection and disease caused by the pathogen? (3) Given that a range of effective responses is likely to occur in response to a vaccine or infection, what does this variation tell us about key parameters of immunological health?    http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8705360&icde=23811246&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC	Vaccination and infection: indicators of immunological health and responsiveness
