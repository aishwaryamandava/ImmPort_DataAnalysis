CD8 T cell recall clonotypes	CD8 tells you what kind of T cell, recall implies a stimulation with a recall antigen, clonotypes implies sequences of some sort.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Cellular Activity	A planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Cellular Phenotype	The physical characteristics of a cell (e.g cell surface markers).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Cellular Quantification	Quantify the number of cells in a sample that express a repetoire of cell surface antigens.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000916
Cytokine Quantification	Quantify the production and/or release of a cytokine by a cell(s) in response to a stimulus(i)/treatment(s).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000615
Enzyme Activity	What does an enzyme do. What are the kinetics. How is it modulated.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Epitope Mapping	Identify the portion of an antigen recognized by an antibody.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Genotyping	Determine DNA sequence at locus in the genome. Compare sequence to canonical sequence and known variants.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000435
Library Preparation	Process which results in the creation of a library from fragments of DNA.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000711
