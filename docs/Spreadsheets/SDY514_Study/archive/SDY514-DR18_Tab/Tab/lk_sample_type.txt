Bone	Skeletal element that is composed of bone tissue.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001474
Carbohydrate	Any member of the class of organooxygen compounds that is a polyhydroxy-aldehyde or -ketone or a lactol resulting from their intramolecular condensation (monosaccharides); substances derived from these by reduction of the carbonyl group (alditols), by oxidation of one or more hydroxy groups to afford the corresponding aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, or by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by a hydrogen atom; and polymeric products arising by intermolecular acetal formation between two or more such molecules (disaccharides, polysaccharides and oligosaccharides). Carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms; prior to any oxidation or reduction, most have the empirical formula Cm(H2O)n. Compounds obtained from carbohydrates by substitution, etc., are known as carbohydrate derivatives and may contain other elements. Cyclitols are generally not regarded as carbohydrates.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_16646
Cell	A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000000
Cell culture supernatant	Supernatant of a cell culture is a material entity which contains media, supplements, and secreted products of the cells and becomes the environment of cultivated cell.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_1000023
Colon	Last portion of the large intestine before it becomes the rectum.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001155

Ileum	The portion of the small intestine that extends from the jejunum to the colon.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002116
Inguinal lymph node	The lymph nodes located in the groin area.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001542

Kidney	A paired organ of the urinary tract which has the production of urine as its primary function.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002113
Lipid	'Lipids' is a loosely defined term for substances of biological origin that are soluble in nonpolar solvents. They consist of saponifiable lipids, such as glycerides (fats and oils) and phospholipids, as well as nonsaponifiable lipids, principally steroids.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_18059

Lymph node	Any of the rounded masses of lymphoid tissue that are surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue, are distributed along the lymphatic vessels, and contain numerous lymphocytes which filter the flow of lymph.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000029
Mesenteric lymph node	The lymph nodes located in the mesentery, of which there are 3 classes: ileocolic, juxtaintestinal mesenteric, and central superior group.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002509
Organ	Anatomical structure that performs a specific function or group of functions.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000062
