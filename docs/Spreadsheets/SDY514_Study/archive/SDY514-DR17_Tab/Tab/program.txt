Applications are sought that propose to study human immune responses (1) following infection, (2) prior to and following vaccination against an infectious disease, or (3) prior to and following treatment with an immune adjuvant that targets a known innate immune receptor(s). The purpose of this FOA is to capitalize on recent advances in immune profiling to measure the diversity of human immune responses under a variety of conditions, using bioinformatic, multiplex, and/or systems biology approaches to study samples from well-characterized human cohorts and to measure aspects of the human transcriptome and/or proteome.
