SDY80		64		Years	The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects (NIH employees) prior to vaccination and then at various time points after receiving the FDA-licensed seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccine.  These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the immune system at baseline and in response to vaccination. To our knowledge, this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or immunome, in a large number of healthy adults (NIH employees). This information may be useful in designing newer, more effective vaccines to prevent the spread of H1N1 influenza.

Both	The primary objective of this protocol is to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the cellular and molecular immune responses in healthy adults at baseline, and after vaccination with either the seasonal H1N1 and the influenza vaccines. This will be the first study to systematically characterize the human immunome in a large number of healthy subjects (specifically NIH Employees).  Furthermore, we anticipate that this protocol may provide information that may be useful in designing newer, more effective vaccines to prevent the spread of influenza, especially H1N1.	2015-09-18 00:00:00	DR15		2019-04-12 00:00:00	DR30	62	21	The primary objective of this protocol is to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the cellular and molecular immune responses in healthy adults at baseline, and after vaccination with either the seasonal H1N1 and the influenza vaccines.
