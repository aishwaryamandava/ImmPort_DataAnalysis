ELISA Protocol

Materials:
	
	Nunc Maxisorp 96 well plates
	Round bottom 96 well dilution plates
	Concentration of the virus to be tested against
	Isotype standards for IgA1, IgG and IgM
	Heat inactivated human serum (treated at 56oC for 30 min)
Purified Influenza A/H1N1/2009/California and 
Influenza A/TEXAS/50/2012 (H3N2)
	3%BSA in PBS
	PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBST)

Protocol:
Day 1
1. 96 well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 10 µg/ml of either H1N1 or H3N2 virus in bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4øC.
2. Isotype standards for IgA1, IgG and IgM (Athens Research & Technology, Inc., Georgia, USA) and blanks wells were also included in each plate.
Day 2
1. After coating, plates were washed and blocked with 3%BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween. 
2. Heat-inactivated sera of young and old subjects from day 0, 10 and 28 were diluted to 1/250 and added to the plate for 2h at room temperature.
3. Plates were washed 4X with PBST using plate washer. 
4. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated mouse anti-human IgA1 at 1:1000, IgG at 1:3000 and IgM at1:1000 (SouthernBiotech, Alabama, USA) dilutions were added to the plates.
5. Plates were further incubated for 1h at room temperature. 
6. After the incubation, the plates were washed 4X with PBST.
7. Plates were developed using alkaline phosphatase substrate containing pNPP tablets (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA) in DEA buffer.
8.  The absorbance was recorded at 405nm. 
9. The absorbance values were plotted against standard curves from each plate for every isotype and the concentration was determined and is expressed in µg/ml.
