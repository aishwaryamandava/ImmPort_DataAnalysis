KurupatiIn-viro Micro-neutralization AssayMaterials:	Madin Darby Kidney Cells (MDCK) in T-150 flash	Flat bottom 96 well tissue culture plates	Round bottom 96 well dilution plates	TCID50 value for the virus to be tested	Heat inactivated human serum (treated at 56oC for 30 min)	Stocks of H1N1 A/California/04/2009 and A/TEXAS/50/2012 (H3N2) virus      TPCK treated trypsinTPCK (+) medium:	Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with L-Glutamine	2.5 mM HEPES buffer	50 µg/mL of gentamycin	1 µg /mL of TPCK treated trypsinTPCK (-) medium:	Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with L-Glutamine	2.5 mM HEPES buffer	50 µg /mL of gentamycin	Protocol:Day 11. MDCK cells grown in T-150 flask were harvested and resuspended at a density of 4 x 105 cells/ml in 10% DMEM. 2. Cells were seeded in flat bottom tissue culture plate at 4 x 104 cells per well by adding 100 µl of the suspension and incubated overnight at 37oC with 5% CO2.Day 21. Heat inactivated 50 µl human serum was 2 fold serially diluted from 1:10 to 1:5120 in TPCK (-) medium in a 96 well round bottom plate. 2. 50 µl of the two Influenza strains Influenza A/H1N1/2009/California and Influenza A/H3N2/2009/ Perth at 100TCID50 was added to the serum samples3. Incubate for 1 hr at 37oC. Virus alone and cells alone controls were also included in each plate.4. In the meantime, overnight grown MDCK cells were washed 2x with TPCK (-) medium.5. At 1 hr, remove the TPCK (-) medium from the MDCK cells and add the serum-virus mixtures by transferring each row with new pipette tips. 6. Incubate the serum/virus mixture for 2 hrs at 37oC with 5% CO2.7. After 2 hrs, remove the serum/virus mixture from the MDCK cells by using a multichannel with new tips at each row.8. Wash the MDCK cells with 1x TPCK (-) with new tips at each row.9. Add 100 µl of TPCK (+) medium and incubate at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 3 days.10. Score for cytopathic effect 3 days later under a microscope.11. The highest serum dilution in which 50% of the MDCK cells were intact was scored as the neutralization titer.
