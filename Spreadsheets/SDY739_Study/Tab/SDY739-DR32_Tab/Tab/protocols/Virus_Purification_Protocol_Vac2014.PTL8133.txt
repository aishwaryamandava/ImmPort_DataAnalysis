Influenza Virus Purification Protocol

Materials:
	
	10 day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs
Stocks of H1N1 A/California/04/2009 and A/TEXAS/50/2012 (H3N2) virus
	Ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman #344059)
	Sucrose Gradient (55% and 10%)
	50 ml conical tubes

Protocol:
Day 1
1. Diluted virus was injected into the eggs and incubated for 48 hrs at 35.5oC and 45% relative humidity with turn intervals of 60 min.
Day 3
2. Post incubation eggs were chilled at 4oC overnight. Allantoic fluid is harvested and spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min.
Day 4
3. Allantoic fluid supernatant containing the virus was collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 hr to concentrate the virus. 
4. Decant the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 0.5 Âµ 1 mL of PBS 
5. Prepare a sucrose density gradient in Beckman tubes 
* 1 mL of Virus
* 5.5 mL 10% sucrose
* 5.5 mL 55% sucrose
6. Spin at 25,000 rpm for 2 hrs at 4oC.
7. Remove the top layer and harvest the purified virus from the interface into fresh ultracentrifuge tube. 
8. Dilute this fraction with PBS and spin at 20,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4oC.
9. Remove supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in PBS and store at -80oC.

Virus titrations
1. The virus was titrated by hemagglutination assay with chicken red blood cells. 
2. The mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was determined by serially diluting virus on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and screening cells 3 days later for viral plaques. 
3. Infectious virus was used for neutralizing antibody assays or inactivated by a 45-minute treatment with betapropionolactone for ELISpot assays.
