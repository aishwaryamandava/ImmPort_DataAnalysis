Northern_Blot	Northern blots are a derivative of Southern blots where RNA that has been size fractionated (often by 1-D gel electrophoresis) is immobilized on a substrate (e.g. a charged nylon membrane). The blot is(are) hybridized with a labeled probe(s). The position on the blot and the intensity of the label's signal can be used to estimate RNA size and concentration, respectively.

Rnase_Protection_Assay	A laboratory technique to identify individual RNA molecules in a heterogeneous RNA sample extracted from cells.	Y	33	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNase_protection_assay
Western_Blot	Western blot is a method in molecular biology/biochemistry/immunogenetics to detect protein in a given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate denatured proteins by mass. The proteins are then transferred out of the gel and onto a membrane (typically nitrocellulose), where they are probed using antibodies specific to the protein. As a result, researchers can examine the amount of protein in a given sample and compare levels between several groups. Other techniques also using antibodies allow detection of proteins in tissues (immunohistochemistry) and cells (immunocytochemistry). The confirmatory HIV test employs a western blot to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human serum sample. A Western blot is also used as the definitive test for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly referred to as 'mad cow disease'). Some forms of Lyme disease testing employ Western blotting.

Mixed_Lymphocyte_Reaction	Mixed lymphocyte reaction test is a measure of histocompatibility at the HLA locus. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from two individuals are mixed together in tissue culture for several days; lymphocytes from incompatible individuals will stimulate each other to proliferate significantly (e.g. measured by tritiated thymidine uptake) whereas those from compatible individuals will not; in the one\-way MLC test, the lymphocytes from one of the individuals are inactivated thereby allowing only the untreated remaining population of cells to proliferate in response to foreign histocompatibility antigens.

Array	Arrays (including microarrays) are a set of probes immobilized on a surface. The probes can be oligonucleotides, cDNAs, antibodies and other molecules that recognize a target. Microarrays can be constructed by several methods including (but not limited to in situ oligo synthesis (e.g. Affymetrix), cDNA spotting, bead arrays (e.g. Illumina) and antibody spotting. The position and identity of probes are provided by the manufacturer. The probe identifiers and their target are referred to as annotation or translation of probe identifiers to bioinformatic identifiers. Microarrays can be used for gene expression (mRNA transcript quantification), genotyping, cytokine quantification, etc. Microarrays for gene expression fall into two general classes- single channel and dual channel. The channel refers to the wavelength scanned for fluorescent signals. Affymetrix microarrays are obligatory single channel.
