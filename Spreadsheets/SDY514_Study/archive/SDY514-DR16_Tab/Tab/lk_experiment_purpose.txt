NAME	DESCRIPTION	LINK
Genotyping	Determine DNA sequence at locus in the genome. Compare sequence to canonical sequence and known variants.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000435
Transcript_Quantification	Quantify the processed mRNA transcribed from a gene. The mRNA is often converted to cDNA or cRNA.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000424
Cellular_Quantification	Quantify the number of cells in a sample that express a repetoire of cell surface antigens.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000916
Molecular_Quantification	Quantify other biomolecules (e.g. protein, hnRNA, DNA, lipids, fats, sugars, amino acids).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Epitope_Mapping	Identify the portion of an antigen recognized by an antibody.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Enzyme_Activity	What does an enzyme do. What are the kinetics. How is it modulated.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070
Localization	Where is an entity found at a given time.	
Cytokine_Quantification	Quantify the production and/or release of a cytokine by a cell(s) in response to a stimulus(i)/treatment(s).

Cellular_Phenotype	The physical characteristics of a cell (e.g cell surface markers).	
Library Preparation	Process which results in the creation of a library from fragments of DNA.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000711
CD8_T_cell_recall_clonotypes	CD8 tells you what kind of T cell, recall implies a stimulation with a recall antigen, clonotypes implies sequences of some sort.	
Neutralizing_Antibody_Titer	Measure the concentration (by titration) of antibody that can neutralize an antigen.	
Virus_Titer	Measure the concentration of a virus by titration (dilution).
