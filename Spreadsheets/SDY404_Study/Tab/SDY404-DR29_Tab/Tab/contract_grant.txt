1461	NIH	In Research Project 1, we will develop immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine responsiveness and determine the effect of aging and functional status on these signatures. We will identify gene signatures and biological pathways that can distinguish between strong and weak immune responses to vaccination and that predict effective responses. In Research Project 2, we will investigate resistance to flaviviral infections using West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus; through analysis of responses in patients from stratified cohorts, we will establish correlations between gene expression, immune cell responses and clinical outcome. In Research Project 3, we will generate mathematical models that detect connectivity and predict dynamic functional responses of the immune system. This approach will link data collected on both populations and individuals using multivariate statistical approaches to integrate cohort-wide data including genome wide association studies and novel single-cell analyses to assess immune responsiveness in relationship to genetic variation. Our functional systems immunology approach will allow us to define baseline human immune signatures following viral infection and vaccination along with deviations from this baseline, with the goal of identifying future targets for intervention and establishing sets of biomarkers that predict responses to vaccination	2015-07-06 00:00:00	AI089992	http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8699127&icde=23814817&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC	Defining signatures for immune responsiveness by functional systems immunology HIPC1	15	2010-07-07 00:00:00
